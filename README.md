**This repo contains some exercises on different recommender system type included in *Hands-On	Recommendation	Systems	with	Python* book:**


- ## Simple Recommender:

  relies on recommending movies based on some metric, in our case we used the weighted average rating, and we considered only movies with enough number of raters.
  
- ## Knowledge-based Recommender:
  
  asking the user about his/her preferences like (genre, duration, timline, etc) then apply a simple recommender on movies that satisfy these conditions.

## Data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).
